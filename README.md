Enterprise Integration Patterns SVG and PNG files

Ease creation of Enterprise Integration Pattern based diagrams per the Enterprise Integration Patterns book by Gregor Hohpe. If you haven't read the book, you should. 

Multiple icon sizes (100%, 80%, 50%, 40% 20%) are provided to help with tools which can import SVG but do not really support SVG scaling. The 20% icons are the best size for typical presentations. To aid some primitive modern tools, PNG's are provided for the 20%.
