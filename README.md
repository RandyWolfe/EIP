Enterprise Integration Patterns SVG and PNG files

Ease creation of Enterprise Integration Pattern based diagrams per the Enterprise Integration Patterns book by Gregor Hohpe. If you haven't read the book, you should. 

Multiple icon sizes are provided to help with tools which can import SVG but do not really support SVG. All professional diagrams should be clear of pixalation. The 20% icons are best sized for typical presentation. To aid with primitive tools, PNG's are provided.
