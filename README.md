Enterprise Integration Patterns SVG and PNG files

Ease creation of Enterprise Integration Pattern based diagrams per the Enterprise Integration Patterns book by Gregor Hohpe. If you haven't read the book, you should. 

Multiple icon sizes (100%, 80%, 50%, 40% 20%) are provided. The 20% icons are the best size for typical presentations. To aid tools which cannot use SVG's, PNG's are provided for the 20%, 40%, and 50% sizes. Mirror images of icons with directional arrows are also provided to avoid bad shadows. Multiple length arrows and Channels are provided to keep from having to strech them for diagrams.
