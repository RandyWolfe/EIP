Enterprise Integration Patterns icons SVG and PNG files

Enable creation of Enterprise Integration Pattern diagrams per the book Enterprise Integration Patterns by Gregor Hohpe. If you haven't read the book, you should. 

Multiple icon sizes (100%, 80%, 50%, 40%, 20%, 10%) are provided. The 20% icons seem best size typical presentation diagrams. To aid tools which cannot use SVG's, PNG's are provided for the 20%, 40%, 50%, and 80% sizes. 

Mirror images of icons with directional arrows are provided to so shadows will be correct whether data is flowing right or left. Multiple length arrows and channels are provided to help avoid distortion from stretching during diagram creation. There are shadowed and non shadowed versions of end points to allow use of the non-shadowed with the Application with End Point items.

The Left/Right in the names indicate the direction of the data entry to the block.
